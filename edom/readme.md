### Structure of Folders

In this folder you should add **all** artifacts developed in exercises of the EDOM course.

You should create a subfolder for each exercise/solution. For instance, subfolder "exercise1/base" will contain all the artifacts for the base solution of exercise 1 of edom; subfolder "exercise1/alternative" will contain all the artifacts for alternative solution of exercise 1 of edom, etc.  

**Note:** If for some reason you need to bypass these guidelines please ask for directions with your teacher and **always** state the exceptions in your commits and issues in bitbucket.
